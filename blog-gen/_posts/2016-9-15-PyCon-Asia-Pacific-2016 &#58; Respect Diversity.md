[Respect Diversity image]

"Respect Diversity" is what comes to my mind, when I recall the PyCon Asia Pacific
2016 in Seoul, South Korea. It was probably the best conference I have ever been to
in the recent times. I made a lot of friends and meet some amazing people there.
Thanks to the PyCon SG and PyCon APAC for helping me financially in attending the
conference and giving me the opportunity to present there. Thanks to Korean Embassy
that I fortunately recieved my visa, just 12 hrs before my flight.

I reached Seoul on 12th August after an extremely long journey due to 20 hour layover
in Guanghzou, China. I stayed at place called Nonhyeon-dong in Gangnum-gu, (the place
where Psy did that famous Gangnam Style. ;). It was a nice place, probably the best
place I could stay in Seoul. Fortunately I managed to get a cheap airbnb near the
conference venue.

## Day 1

I reached the venue pretty early at around 8:30. I was amazed by the beauty of the
venue, the Coex Mall, asia's largest underground shopping mall. The moment I went
inside, I had the feeling that this is probably the best conference, venue
I have ever seen. Kudos to the organizers for putting up all the hardwork to
get such a venue. The Day 1 started with the Keynote by Wes McKinney, where
he discussed various aspects of Open Source. He was an accidental Software Developer,
who started writing python libraries to make his work better. He also talked about,
how the Open Source can be made sustainable and also discussed a bit about pandas, of
which he is the author. The second keynote was by Jacob Kaplan-Moss who unfortunately
couldn't come to the conference, though he delivered Keynote through Google Hangouts,
which was broadcasted live into the hall.

My talk was scheduled in the evening. Quite a good number of people showed up, although
it was the last talk of the day. I started my talk in Korean, which I learnt from from
friend Hassan and Sujin. They got pretty excited by hearing Korean from an Indian ;)
Here is the video of my talk.

In the evening, we went to a nearby temple which was pretty amazing. I also met Jason
and Amanda, who became good friends.

## Day 2

The Day 2 was more interesting than one, as it started with meeting Armin Ronacher,
who is known for creation of Flask. It was an excellent talk, he talked about the
various lessons he learned from working on various projects. His talk was followed by
Maciej Fija≈Çkowski, who is a core Developer of PyPy. He talked about various aspects
of funding in Open Source, which is indeed a crucial component for the sustainance of
Open Source projects. There were lots of interesting talk on Day 2. There was a high
school guy, who gave a talk on Django vs Flask, but unfortunately it was in Korean.
One of the talk was so well recieved that they had to repeat it twice!
(Building AI Chat bot using Python 3 & TensorFlow)

The Day two ended with the lightning talks, where I gave a talk on Soldier, a
module written by friend of mine on top of subprocess module to provide an nice
user API to the user.

We were called for a nice Dinner at Viking's Buffet after the conference, with all
the speakers and volunteers. It was a great evening spent with the geeks around.
I am thankful to a lot of people for making my stay and journey comfortable in
Seoul, I would like to thank all of them specially Amanda, Jason, Hassan, Kookheon,
Sujin lee, Younggun Kim, Liew Beng Keat, I don't remember all the names, sorry,
If I missed some of them! Thanks to whole team of PyCon APAC 2016 for putting up
a wonderful show at Coex, PyCon SG for generously funding my travel and Kookheon
for helping me with getting documents for making my travel possible. Kudos to the
whole community! Looking forward to come back soon! ;)
