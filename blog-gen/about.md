Hi there! thanks for stumbling upon my website. I am a  Mathematics and

I am programmer, learner, presenter and a Software Engineer in the
process. I have spoken at various national and international conferences
and local meetups. Here is a [link](http://iamit.in/talks) to all of my
presentations.

I am usually found at New Delhi, India. This Website is my Internet Address.
You may find me with handle "aktech" on the Web.
