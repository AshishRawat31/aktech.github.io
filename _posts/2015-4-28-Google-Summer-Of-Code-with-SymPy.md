# About SymPy

> SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured **Computer Algebra System** (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.
